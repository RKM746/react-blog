shares climbed more than 5 percent on the news, as the market evidently took it as a sign the acquisition is moving forward despite Musk declaring it on hold due to his concerns about the number of accounts that might be software bots instead of real people. Musk said in the regulatory filing that he had new commitments that will allow him to rely less on loans to buy Twitter, but did not specify whether he was reaching into his own pocket for money or had won over others with big stakes in the company Analysts were concerned about Musk using billions of dollars worth of his Tesla shares to back loans, meaning the electric car company's stock price would be affected by the fortunes of Twitter  .\"\n  }, {\n    \"id\": 16,\n    \"title\": \"Explained: Will Amber Heard or Johnny Depp go to prison if other party wins? \",\n    \"Image\": \"https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2022/05/29/550x309/Amber_Johnny_1653803672420_1653803684854.jpeg\",\n    \"category\": \"Hollywood\",\n    \"description\": \"Dohnny Depp and Amber Heard’s bitter and public defamation trial came to a close on Friday as both parties rested their case, and the judge handed the case over to the jury. Now, the jury will deliberate over the case’s facts and findings and deliver their verdict next week. The high-profile defamation trial has seen its fair share of twists and turns. But now the question on everyone’s lips is what would be the outcome. As per reports, Johnny Depp is heavily favoured to emerge victorious in his suit against his ex-wife. But if he does win, what does that mean for Amber? We take a look.Johnny has sued Amber for $50 million saying she defamed him when she claimed to be a victim of domestic violence in a Washington Post op-ed in 2018. Johnny’s lawyers have said that even though Amber didn’t name him, the implication damaged his career. He has further alleged that Amber was abusive towards him during their marriage. Amber has countersued him for $100 million claiming that he has smeared her name by calling her a liar. She has maintained that she suffered physical and sexual abuse at Johnny’s hands. Both trials ran concurrently in a Virginia court for over six weeks.

Maverick has been projected to earn $125 million in its opening weekend, which will comfortably make it he best opener in the actor's long career.As per trade reports, Tom Cruise’s upcoming film Top Gun: Maverick could end up registering the biggest opening by any film of his career. Despite his stardom, Tom has never had a film gross over $100 million on the opening weekend. But reports say that Maverick may just change that. Some estimates claim that the film could end up making $125 million in its opening weekend in the domestic market alone.According to a report in The Hollywood Reporter, “Top Gun 2 is easily headed for the biggest opening of Tom Cruise’s career at the domestic box office, with a four-day gross of at least $92 million, according to official tracking. And that’s a conservative estimate. Many pundits believe the critically acclaimed sequel could soar well north of $100 million domestically, but tracking — one of Hollywood’s favorite pastimes — has become fraught in the pandemic era. Exhibitors are especially bullish on the pic, and are even thinking $125 million-plus.”\"\n  }, {\n    \"id\": 21,\n    \"title\": \"Upcoming Apple Products Guide: Everything We Expect to See in 2022 and Beyond \",\n    \"Image\": \"https://images.macrumors.com/t/PjPeF9qcBOpANQ24HifdHKFkli0=/1600x0/article-new/2021/12/What-to-Expect-Apple-2022.jpg\",\n    \"category\": \"Technology\",\n    \"description\": \"The MacRumors guide to upcoming products is designed to provide an overview of everything that we're expecting to see from Apple, both in the near and more distant future.

This conversation just reinforced my belief that there will be takers for Microsoft’s experimental Surface Laptop Studio, which blends certain elements of the desktop Surface Studio and the premium 2-in-1 Surface Book. It’s a mobile workstation that’s also a sketching slate and a portable home theater.

Here, we have put together a list of celestial events that we can look forward to seeing in 2022.After the partial eclipse visible in certain parts of South America on April 30 this year, there is only one more solar eclipse left for us to witness: a partial one that will happen on October 25 and will be visible in Europe, Northeast Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia, including India. The greatest part of the eclipse will be visible to viewers in India so save the date on your calendar.The total lunar eclipse that occurred on May 16 this year will not be the only one this year: another total lunar eclipse is predicted to happen once again on November 8 this year. However, just like the previous full lunar eclipse, it is unlikely that this one would be visible from India. But just like the one in May, the lunar eclipse in November will also presumably be live-streamed by multiple sources, allowing you to catch a glimpse.\"\n  }, {\n    \"id\": 23,\n    \"title\": \"Ather responds to fire incident in Chennai showroom; blames service error \",\n    \"Image\": \"https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/05/Ather-Energy-showroom-fire-factory-hosur.jpg\",\n    \"category\": \"Technology\",\n    \"description\": \"Indian electric two-wheeler manufacturer Ather Energy has given an official statement about the fire that happened in one of its showrooms in Chennai on May 27. Shortly after the incident was reported, Ather’s official Twitter handle confirmed the fire while saying that no employee was harmed during the incident.According to a statement issued by the company later, the incident happened due to a vehicle that was brought into the showroom for servicing after it had an accident. Since there was a lot of dust and mud on the vehicle, the staff at the service centre reportedly used a high-pressure water wash to clean the vehicle before inspecting it.Ather says that the service team discovered some cracks in the top casing of the battery pack. But by then, water had entered the battery casing due to the high-pressure wash. The company says that letting in water into the battery is an “impossible to solve scenario,” and that the scooter was “moved to a safer area,” as soon as this was observed.\"\n  }, {\n    \"id\": 24,\n    \"title\": \"Russia opens cases against Google, other foreign tech over data storage \",\n    \"Image\": \"https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/05/Google-AP.jpg\",\n    \"category\": \"Technology\",\n    \"description\": \"Russia’s communications regulator Roskomnadzor said on Friday it had opened administrative cases against Alphabet Inc’s Google and six other foreign technology companies for alleged violations of personal data legislation.Moscow has clashed with Big Tech over content, censorship, data and local representation in a simmering dispute that has erupted into a full-on information battle since Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.Russia fined Google 3 million roubles ($46,540) last year for not storing the personal data of Russian users in databases on Russian territory, and on Friday said it had opened a new case over what it called Google’s repeated failure to comply with Russian legislation.The regulator also said it had opened cases against six other companies – Airbnb, Pinterest, Likeme, Twitch, Apple and United Parcel Service – for alleged first-time offences carrying a potential fine of 1-6 million roubles.\"\n  }, {\n    \"id\": 25,\n    \"title\": \"Raju Narisetti interview: ‘Wikipedia is building trust with transparency’ \",\n    \"Image\": \"https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/05/raju-narisetti.jpg\",\n    \"category\": \"Technology\",\n    \"description\": \"Within hours of the shooting in Texas, the Wikipedia page of the Robb Elementary School in Uvalde had seen 765 edits from 154 different contributors and was overseen by 103 page-watchers who ensure only accurate information is published.

In my grandmother’s home where I lived for the first 15 years of my life and even when we moved lock stock and tapeli to where my parents made their new home, dahi was always made in the kitchen. It was a daily process. Every day milk would be boiled and cooled to room temperature. A medium-heavy bottomed pot would be greased with the previous day’s dahi, which worked like a bacterial curd starter, and the boiled warm milk would be poured in. A wet cloth kept the milk covered as nature created magic, fermented the milk, added wonderfully healthy probiotic characteristics, thickened it and set it to curd. It would take four to five hours on a normal warm, hot and humid Mumbai day, eight to 12 in cold weather, that was it. Sometimes we’d make curd two times a day, just to be able to have it fresh. There was also a kind of romantic uncertainty about how well the curd would set. Sometimes it could set loosely, separating the water from the milk and sometimes it would be firm and silky. After all milk wasn’t bought homogenised, standardised and in a carton, but was bought at the doorstep from a doodhwala, whose honesty was always in question. So obviously, the better the milk the better the curd. The pot of milk with the curd starter would always be kept in a warm place and most importantly left alone. One old ladies’ tale was that you could add a green chilly with its stem intact to help the curd set faster. Ostensibly, the chilly with the stem would not impart any taste but contained certain bacteria that activated the milk to produce protein curdles that turned milk into curd faster. I’d actually never seen that happening in any of our kitchens.\"\n  }, {\n    \"id\": 47,\n    \"title\": \"Naga Cuisine is Just as Rich And Flavourful as its Culture\",\n    \"Image\": \"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2021/12/nagaland-16386760023x2.jpg?impolicy=website&width=510&height=356\",\n    \"category\": \"Food\",\n    \"description\": \"Nagaland is known for its cultural, ethnic and linguistic diversity.

However, do you know with time the nutrition value of fruits and vegetables are declining? Yes, you read that right. With time, due to various reasons that nutrition in fruits and vegetables have declined tremendously leaving us with various deficiencies. According to a National Geographic report, the experts find the root of the problem in the quality of soil. In the last few decades, the soil quality has been compromised due to various reasons including excessive chemical use, fertilisers, irrigation and so on. The harvesting methods have changed from natural ways to machineries which has also taken a dig at the health of the soil. Apart from it, due to global warming and climate change, the atmospheric temperature is rising and making the soil lose its moisture even more that do not hold the crops well putting them in risk of losing nutrition.The report also states that due to carbon dioxide increase in the air, the nutrient content of the fruits, vegetables and other crops are pulling down.David R. Montgomery, a professor of geomorphology at the University of Washington in Seattle emphasis on one of the major risks of the lower nutrient value, that is making our immunity low. According to him, “Nutrient decline is going to leave our bodies with fewer of the components they need to mount defences against chronic diseases — it’s going to undercut the value of food as preventive medicine,” state National Geographic.\"\n  }, {\n    \"id\": 49,\n    \"title\": \"These Harmless Summer Drinks are Perfect for Diabetic Patients\",\n    \"Image\": \"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2022/05/summer-drink-16518193713x2.jpg?impolicy=website&width=510&height=356\",\n    \"category\": \"Food\",\n    \"description\": \"The summer season is here with soaring temperatures and dehydrating weather.

While many people find it easily in the supermarket, others may find it difficult to spot tofu at their local stores. If you are one of those people, don’t worry as this simple method can help you make protein-rich tofu at home with just two ingredients – chickpeas and water.Once the tofu is set, you can use it as and when required. It is as tasty as the tofu bought from a store and tofu is as versatile as cottage cheese. It can be used in dry and wet recipes depending on your mood and diet requirements. Chickpea is rich in protein and hence the tofu is a great source of protein to help you complete the daily protein requirement.Soak the chickpeas overnight after thoroughly washing with the help of a strainer under running water.Drain all the water and wash the chickpeas the next day. Add chickpeas with two cups of water in a blender and blend in batches until you have a smooth mixture.Strain the blended chickpeas through a muslin cloth into a bowl. Make a squeezable bag out of the muslin cloth with the mixture in it. Squeeze the blend well to strain it nicely. As the water drains slowly from the mixture, it takes some time to strain the blend.Take the strained blend and put it in a pot. Keep the pot on full flame and let the mixture boil. Once you see bubbles, lower the flame and cook the blend for another half n hour. The mixture will thicken with time. When it is thick enough, put off the flame and let the blend cool down for a while. Leave the mixture in a container for more than 2 hours idle. This will ensure that the mixture sits and the tofu sets properly\"\n  }]);\n  return /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n    children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(store.Provider, {\n      value: [details, setDetails],\n      children: props.children\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 446,\n      columnNumber: 7\n    }, this)\n  }, void 0, false, {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 445,\n    columnNumber: 5\n  }, this);\n};\n\n_s(Details, \"+3jjMfpyeglKQVYvq2LqtDhcp+M=\");\n\n_c = Details;\nexport default Details;\n\nvar _c;\n\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"Details\");","map":{"version":3,"names":["React","createContext","useState","store","Details","props","details","setDetails","children"],"sources":["/Users/rkm/Desktop/React-blog/my-app/src/Pages/Details.js"],"sourcesContent":["import React, { createContext, useState } from 'react'\n\nexport const store = createContext()\n\nconst Details = (props) => {\n  const [details, setDetails] = useState([\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"title\": \"Mira Kapoor shares an unseen photo of her baby boy Zain on his 4th birthday; grandmother Neelima Azeem showers love – See post\",\n      \"Image\": \"https://c.ndtvimg.com/mira-kapoor_instagram_625x300_1528737043977.jpg\",\n      \"category\": \"Bollywood\",\n      \"description\": \"Mira Rajput Kapoor shared an unseen photo of her handsome little boy Zain with her fans on his fourth birthday along with a sweet post.Mira Rajput Kapoor shared an unseen photo of her handsome little boy Zain with her fans on his fourth birthday along with a sweet post.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 51,\n      \"title\": \"A Trailer of Hrithik Roshan-Saif Ali Khan’s Vikram Vedha to be played in cinemas before the shows of Brahmastra\",\n      \"Image\": \"https://media2.bollywoodhungama.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BREAKING-Trailer-of-Hrithik-Roshan-Saif-Ali-Khan%E2%80%99s-Vikram-Vedha-to-be-played-in-cinemas-before-the-shows-of-Brahmastra.jpeg\",\n      \"category\": \"bollywood\",\n      \"description\": \"Brahmastra, starring Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt, would be out this Friday, on September 9 while the trailer of Vikram Vedha would be released on September 8.

shares climbed more than 5 percent on the news, as the market evidently took it as a sign the acquisition is moving forward despite Musk declaring it on hold due to his concerns about the number of accounts that might be software bots instead of real people. Musk said in the regulatory filing that he had new commitments that will allow him to rely less on loans to buy Twitter, but did not specify whether he was reaching into his own pocket for money or had won over others with big stakes in the company Analysts were concerned about Musk using billions of dollars worth of his Tesla shares to back loans, meaning the electric car company's stock price would be affected by the fortunes of Twitter  .\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": 16,\n    \"title\": \"Explained: Will Amber Heard or Johnny Depp go to prison if other party wins? \",\n    \"Image\": \"https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2022/05/29/550x309/Amber_Johnny_1653803672420_1653803684854.jpeg\",\n    \"category\": \"Hollywood\",\n    \"description\": \"Dohnny Depp and Amber Heard’s bitter and public defamation trial came to a close on Friday as both parties rested their case, and the judge handed the case over to the jury. Now, the jury will deliberate over the case’s facts and findings and deliver their verdict next week. The high-profile defamation trial has seen its fair share of twists and turns. But now the question on everyone’s lips is what would be the outcome. As per reports, Johnny Depp is heavily favoured to emerge victorious in his suit against his ex-wife. But if he does win, what does that mean for Amber? We take a look.Johnny has sued Amber for $50 million saying she defamed him when she claimed to be a victim of domestic violence in a Washington Post op-ed in 2018. Johnny’s lawyers have said that even though Amber didn’t name him, the implication damaged his career. He has further alleged that Amber was abusive towards him during their marriage. Amber has countersued him for $100 million claiming that he has smeared her name by calling her a liar. She has maintained that she suffered physical and sexual abuse at Johnny’s hands. Both trials ran concurrently in a Virginia court for over six weeks.

Maverick has been projected to earn $125 million in its opening weekend, which will comfortably make it he best opener in the actor's long career.As per trade reports, Tom Cruise’s upcoming film Top Gun: Maverick could end up registering the biggest opening by any film of his career. Despite his stardom, Tom has never had a film gross over $100 million on the opening weekend. But reports say that Maverick may just change that. Some estimates claim that the film could end up making $125 million in its opening weekend in the domestic market alone.According to a report in The Hollywood Reporter, “Top Gun 2 is easily headed for the biggest opening of Tom Cruise’s career at the domestic box office, with a four-day gross of at least $92 million, according to official tracking. And that’s a conservative estimate. Many pundits believe the critically acclaimed sequel could soar well north of $100 million domestically, but tracking — one of Hollywood’s favorite pastimes — has become fraught in the pandemic era. Exhibitors are especially bullish on the pic, and are even thinking $125 million-plus.”\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": 21,\n    \"title\": \"Upcoming Apple Products Guide: Everything We Expect to See in 2022 and Beyond \",\n    \"Image\": \"https://images.macrumors.com/t/PjPeF9qcBOpANQ24HifdHKFkli0=/1600x0/article-new/2021/12/What-to-Expect-Apple-2022.jpg\",\n    \"category\": \"Technology\",\n    \"description\": \"The MacRumors guide to upcoming products is designed to provide an overview of everything that we're expecting to see from Apple, both in the near and more distant future.

This conversation just reinforced my belief that there will be takers for Microsoft’s experimental Surface Laptop Studio, which blends certain elements of the desktop Surface Studio and the premium 2-in-1 Surface Book. It’s a mobile workstation that’s also a sketching slate and a portable home theater.

Here, we have put together a list of celestial events that we can look forward to seeing in 2022.After the partial eclipse visible in certain parts of South America on April 30 this year, there is only one more solar eclipse left for us to witness: a partial one that will happen on October 25 and will be visible in Europe, Northeast Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia, including India. The greatest part of the eclipse will be visible to viewers in India so save the date on your calendar.The total lunar eclipse that occurred on May 16 this year will not be the only one this year: another total lunar eclipse is predicted to happen once again on November 8 this year. However, just like the previous full lunar eclipse, it is unlikely that this one would be visible from India. But just like the one in May, the lunar eclipse in November will also presumably be live-streamed by multiple sources, allowing you to catch a glimpse.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": 23,\n    \"title\": \"Ather responds to fire incident in Chennai showroom; blames service error \",\n    \"Image\": \"https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/05/Ather-Energy-showroom-fire-factory-hosur.jpg\",\n    \"category\": \"Technology\",\n    \"description\": \"Indian electric two-wheeler manufacturer Ather Energy has given an official statement about the fire that happened in one of its showrooms in Chennai on May 27. Shortly after the incident was reported, Ather’s official Twitter handle confirmed the fire while saying that no employee was harmed during the incident.According to a statement issued by the company later, the incident happened due to a vehicle that was brought into the showroom for servicing after it had an accident. Since there was a lot of dust and mud on the vehicle, the staff at the service centre reportedly used a high-pressure water wash to clean the vehicle before inspecting it.Ather says that the service team discovered some cracks in the top casing of the battery pack. But by then, water had entered the battery casing due to the high-pressure wash. The company says that letting in water into the battery is an “impossible to solve scenario,” and that the scooter was “moved to a safer area,” as soon as this was observed.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": 24,\n    \"title\": \"Russia opens cases against Google, other foreign tech over data storage \",\n    \"Image\": \"https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/05/Google-AP.jpg\",\n    \"category\": \"Technology\",\n    \"description\": \"Russia’s communications regulator Roskomnadzor said on Friday it had opened administrative cases against Alphabet Inc’s Google and six other foreign technology companies for alleged violations of personal data legislation.Moscow has clashed with Big Tech over content, censorship, data and local representation in a simmering dispute that has erupted into a full-on information battle since Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.Russia fined Google 3 million roubles ($46,540) last year for not storing the personal data of Russian users in databases on Russian territory, and on Friday said it had opened a new case over what it called Google’s repeated failure to comply with Russian legislation.The regulator also said it had opened cases against six other companies – Airbnb, Pinterest, Likeme, Twitch, Apple and United Parcel Service – for alleged first-time offences carrying a potential fine of 1-6 million roubles.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": 25,\n    \"title\": \"Raju Narisetti interview: ‘Wikipedia is building trust with transparency’ \",\n    \"Image\": \"https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/05/raju-narisetti.jpg\",\n    \"category\": \"Technology\",\n    \"description\": \"Within hours of the shooting in Texas, the Wikipedia page of the Robb Elementary School in Uvalde had seen 765 edits from 154 different contributors and was overseen by 103 page-watchers who ensure only accurate information is published.

The third, a control group, did at least 30 minutes of daily activity, but at a low intensity and didn't have heart rate measured.There was one major aspect of improvement that wasn't related to heart rate or cortical thickness, Dr. Haberg adds—it was whether the participants felt control over their choices.

Therefore, having an early breakfast gives it a boost and an early dinner help it sustain.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": 46,\n    \"title\": \"What The Fork: Kunal Vijayakar on the Perfect Summer Food to Beat the Heat\",\n    \"Image\": \"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2022/05/curd-rice-1-16519277623x2.jpg?impolicy=website&width=510&height=356\",\n    \"category\": \"Food\",\n    \"description\": \"​​ How soon we renounce age-old traditions in the praxis of food, and succumb to the allure of convenience, short cuts, and finished good-looking products. I’m talking about age old dahi or curd. In my grandmother’s home where I lived for the first 15 years of my life and even when we moved lock stock and tapeli to where my parents made their new home, dahi was always made in the kitchen. It was a daily process. Every day milk would be boiled and cooled to room temperature. A medium-heavy bottomed pot would be greased with the previous day’s dahi, which worked like a bacterial curd starter, and the boiled warm milk would be poured in. A wet cloth kept the milk covered as nature created magic, fermented the milk, added wonderfully healthy probiotic characteristics, thickened it and set it to curd. It would take four to five hours on a normal warm, hot and humid Mumbai day, eight to 12 in cold weather, that was it. Sometimes we’d make curd two times a day, just to be able to have it fresh. There was also a kind of romantic uncertainty about how well the curd would set. Sometimes it could set loosely, separating the water from the milk and sometimes it would be firm and silky. After all milk wasn’t bought homogenised, standardised and in a carton, but was bought at the doorstep from a doodhwala, whose honesty was always in question. So obviously, the better the milk the better the curd. The pot of milk with the curd starter would always be kept in a warm place and most importantly left alone. One old ladies’ tale was that you could add a green chilly with its stem intact to help the curd set faster. Ostensibly, the chilly with the stem would not impart any taste but contained certain bacteria that activated the milk to produce protein curdles that turned milk into curd faster. I’d actually never seen that happening in any of our kitchens.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": 47,\n    \"title\": \"Naga Cuisine is Just as Rich And Flavourful as its Culture\",\n    \"Image\": \"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2021/12/nagaland-16386760023x2.jpg?impolicy=website&width=510&height=356\",\n    \"category\": \"Food\",\n    \"description\": \"Nagaland is known for its cultural, ethnic and linguistic diversity.

They are said to be the best way to provide nutrition to the body and boost immunity. Every season comes with a variety of grains, vegetables, and fruits and we can’t agree more that they are tastier than the stored ones. However, do you know with time the nutrition value of fruits and vegetables are declining? Yes, you read that right. With time, due to various reasons that nutrition in fruits and vegetables have declined tremendously leaving us with various deficiencies. According to a National Geographic report, the experts find the root of the problem in the quality of soil. In the last few decades, the soil quality has been compromised due to various reasons including excessive chemical use, fertilisers, irrigation and so on. The harvesting methods have changed from natural ways to machineries which has also taken a dig at the health of the soil. Apart from it, due to global warming and climate change, the atmospheric temperature is rising and making the soil lose its moisture even more that do not hold the crops well putting them in risk of losing nutrition.The report also states that due to carbon dioxide increase in the air, the nutrient content of the fruits, vegetables and other crops are pulling down.David R. Montgomery, a professor of geomorphology at the University of Washington in Seattle emphasis on one of the major risks of the lower nutrient value, that is making our immunity low. According to him, “Nutrient decline is going to leave our bodies with fewer of the components they need to mount defences against chronic diseases — it’s going to undercut the value of food as preventive medicine,” state National Geographic.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": 49,\n    \"title\": \"These Harmless Summer Drinks are Perfect for Diabetic Patients\",\n    \"Image\": \"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2022/05/summer-drink-16518193713x2.jpg?impolicy=website&width=510&height=356\",\n    \"category\": \"Food\",\n    \"description\": \"The summer season is here with soaring temperatures and dehydrating weather.

While many people find it easily in the supermarket, others may find it difficult to spot tofu at their local stores. If you are one of those people, don’t worry as this simple method can help you make protein-rich tofu at home with just two ingredients – chickpeas and water.Once the tofu is set, you can use it as and when required. It is as tasty as the tofu bought from a store and tofu is as versatile as cottage cheese. It can be used in dry and wet recipes depending on your mood and diet requirements. Chickpea is rich in protein and hence the tofu is a great source of protein to help you complete the daily protein requirement.Soak the chickpeas overnight after thoroughly washing with the help of a strainer under running water.Drain all the water and wash the chickpeas the next day. Add chickpeas with two cups of water in a blender and blend in batches until you have a smooth mixture.Strain the blended chickpeas through a muslin cloth into a bowl. Make a squeezable bag out of the muslin cloth with the mixture in it. Squeeze the blend well to strain it nicely. As the water drains slowly from the mixture, it takes some time to strain the blend.Take the strained blend and put it in a pot. Keep the pot on full flame and let the mixture boil. Once you see bubbles, lower the flame and cook the blend for another half n hour. The mixture will thicken with time. When it is thick enough, put off the flame and let the blend cool down for a while. Leave the mixture in a container for more than 2 hours idle. This will ensure that the mixture sits and the tofu sets properly\"\n  },\n  \n  ]);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <store.Provider value={[details, setDetails]}>\n\n        {props.children}\n\n\n
